# Introduction
This project is an object detection system developed by RFAI tech based on VLMs, aiming to provide efficient and accurate object detection capabilities. The project currently only offers basic inference functionality, and will continue to improve and optimize, including model fine-tuning, object tracking optimization, data augmentation, and more. Currently, the OWLV2 model is used as the default model.

# Quick Start
